# Ball Game - Step 4 branch

> In this step we added a paddle that moves along the bottom of the screen when we press the arrow keys.

> We will add collision detection so the ball bounces away when the paddle hits it.

> We added a counter variable that keeps track of the number of hits on the paddle.
