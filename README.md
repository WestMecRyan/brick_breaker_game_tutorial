# Ball Game - This is the main branch read me.

## This tutorial will show you how to build a ball and paddle brick breaker game. It is currently a work in progress tutorial.

## Use git checkout step-1 to start at the first step of the project.

> use git clone to clone this project into a google drive folder.
> The goal of the project is to create a canvas that displays a ball, a paddle, and some bricks.
> The ball will bounce off of the paddle and the bricks and if the ball hits the floor you lose a "life".
> If the ball breaks bricks you earn a "point".
