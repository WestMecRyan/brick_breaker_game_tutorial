# Ball Game - Step 3 branch

> In this step we will add a color array to change the color of ball when it hits the walls.
> We will use a switch case statement

> In this branch we will add the speed slider and pause button but not any interactivity. We will also make the color of the ball change when it hits the walls.
> We will also make the game pause when we click the pause button
> We will also take a value from the input slider to change the speed of the ball.
