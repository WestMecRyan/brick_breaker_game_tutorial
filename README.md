# Ball Game - Step 4 branch

> In this step we will add a paddle that moves along the bottom of the screen when we press the arrow keys, move the mouse or touch the screen.

> We will add collision detection so the ball bounces away when the paddle hits it.

## test branch notes

I'm on branch-4 but I'm running var tests. I want to add a working variable to hit the paddle. And merge it back into the step-4.
